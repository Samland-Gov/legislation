# legislation

This repository contains all legislation published in the official gazette of the Republic of Samland.

Each legislation is made up of a `.txt` file and `.json` file. The `.json` file contains metadata about the legislation and the `.txt` contains the actual content.

Legislation content is written with the [Bluebell](https://github.com/laws-africa/bluebell) grammar, and is uploaded to the Indigo Platform hosted for Samland by Miners Online.
